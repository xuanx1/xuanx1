### 👋 Hi, I’m Xuan

- 👀 I’m interested in data storytelling, urban technology, and socially driven design.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on civic tech, open data visualization, and creative urban analytics.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I’ve prototyped tools that merge spatial planning with real-time transport data—powered entirely by open government APIs.
